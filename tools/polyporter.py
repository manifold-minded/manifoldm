"""PolyPorter: A tool for exchanging polygon data between ZBrush and Maya.

This module provides functionality to export ZBrush polygons with polygroups to Maya
as polygons with vertex colors using USD (Universal Scene Description) as the
intermediate format. The tool preserves polygroup information by converting it to
vertex colors that can be manipulated in Maya.
